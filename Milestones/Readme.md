# 🌟 LangChain + Google Gemini — Milestone 1

This is a small, beginner-friendly project where I experimented with *LangChain* using *Google Gemini* as the LLM.  
The goal of this milestone is just to understand the basics — nothing too fancy — but enough to get comfortable with how LangChain works.

In this first milestone, I built:

- ✔ A simple explanation demo using *PromptTemplate + LLMChain*
- ✔ Two basic tools (a greeting tool and a weather tool)
- ✔ A *Zero-Shot ReAct Agent* that decides when to use these tools
- ✔ A small *console REPL* so I can chat with the agent directly

> ⚠ *Note:*  
This project still uses the older “classic” LangChain APIs like LLMChain, initialize_agent, and ConversationBufferMemory.  
They’re easy to learn but raise some deprecation warnings — which is fine for this milestone.  
In Milestone-2, I’ll move to the newer LangChain v1 patterns (Runnables, Agents v2, etc.).
